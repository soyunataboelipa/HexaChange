3D STARTER NOTES

These modules are intentionally SIMPLE.
- They render a heart (extruded shape) and a basic dice cube.
- No physics yet. No pip textures yet.
- Next steps when you ask for full code:
  1) Add pip textures or normal maps to dice faces.
  2) Add cannon-es physics, sync final result from host (authoritative).
  3) Use overlay canvas positioned fixed over the blurred board.
